To work with Git SSH 
-----------------------
By default whne you clone with https, the origins are added https url. In order to work with already setup SSH keys, we need to remove the existing one and add below

git remote -v 
git remote remove origin 
git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repo.git  

make sure you authenticate with SSH Pharaphrase instead of your github credentials
